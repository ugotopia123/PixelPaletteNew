                                                ---- Introduction ----                                                
            - Pixel Palette is a program designed to quickly draw images with a given palette of colors -             
        - I built this in Flash with the intention to optimize the image drawing as efficiently as possible -         
                      - It can process extremely large images both in dimension and file size -                       
                   - Tests have succeeded with images of up to 64 million pixels and 50MB in size -

      - Import Palette: Imports a PNG to use as a palette. You can make your own or choose one of the defaults -      
                    - Import Image: Imports a PNG, JPG, or BMP to draw with the current palette -                     
               - Reset Image: Resets the drawn image to its default scale and centers it on the screen -              
                        - Redraw Image: Redraws the imported image with the current palette -                         
                                 - Export Image: Allows you to save the drawn image -                                 
                               - Copy Image: Copies the drawn image to the clipboard -

     - The program has its limits. It's possible to cause a crash by importing/exporting extremely large images -     
  - The time it takes to draw an image is dependent on both the image size and the number of colors in the palette -
       - If you experience crashes you may have to reduce either the file size or the dimensions of the image -       
  - If the program isn't responding during exporting you may have to just wait for the program to process the data -  
                               - If all else fails, restart the program and try again -
